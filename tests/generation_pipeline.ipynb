      " Manafossen (or Månafossen [“Moon Falls”?, I’ve also seen it spelled Monafossen and Månefossen]; I think it’s pronounced “MOH-nuh-foss-un”) was definitely our favorite waterfall in Rogaland county.\n",
      "It was probably the first major waterfall that made us go “WoW!” during our June 2005 trip.\n",
      "Hiking to MånafossenGetting to Manafossen from the car park required us to go up a steep (and potentially slippery) uphill hike.\n",
      "This was the extent of our experiences with the Manafossen Waterfall, and we would typically spend around an hour away from the car.\n",
