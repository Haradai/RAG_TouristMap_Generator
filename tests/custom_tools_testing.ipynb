The infamous Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was located not far from Belsen, one of several farming villages in the borough.\\n\\nBergen is a former agricultural town, but today is economically heavily dependent on the surrounding military bases and the Bergen-Hohne Training Area to the west, which is the largest military training area in Western Europe.\\n\\nUnderstand [ edit ]\\n\\nBergen was first mentioned in 1197 and was a centre of local government, the seat of the sheriff (Amtsvogtei) and, later, the Royal Hanoverian Office. After the Kingdom of Hanover was annexed by Prussia in 1866, Bergen was absorbed into Fallingbostel district. In the reorganisation of 1885, however, Bergen was transferred into the newly formed Celle district.\\n\\nBergen town hall\\n\\nBergen's development as a market town was rather slow during the Middle Ages and the early part of the Modern Age, hampered by serious fires in 1354, 1585 and 1796, but the agricultural reform in the 19th century and the town's connection to the Celle–Soltau railway led to far-reaching changes. The biggest change, however, was the creation of Bergen-Hohne Training Area in 1935 by the Nazis, which led to Bergen's transformation from an agriculturally-based village into the small town it is today, characterised by trade and commerce with agriculture having largely lost its significance. Until 2015, it was home to a British base, the Bergen-Hohne Garrison, which hosted up to 5,000 soldiers.\\n\\nToday Bergen is a local borough town in the northern part of Celle district and is, after Celle, the only political entity in the district, having been granted town status in 1957. During the community reorganisation of 1971, Bergen was given responsibility for the parishes of Becklingen, Belsen, Bleckmar, Diesten, Dohnsen, Eversen, Hagen, Hassel, Nindorf, Offen, Sülze and Wardböhmen. That significantly increased the size of its population and area. Today around 13,000 people live in the town of Bergen (2019).\\n\\nTourist information [ edit ]\\n\\nGet in [ edit ]\\n\\nMap of Bergen (Germany)\\n\\nBy car [ edit ]\\n\\nBergen is located on the main B3 route which runs from north to south between Soltau and Celle. Access from Hanover centre (the nearest city) is via the A37 which connects to the B3 in a north-easterly direction. The journey is approximately 70 km and take around 50 minutes.\\n\\nDriving from Bremen will take you on the A27 autobahn which connects to the A7 to the south-east of Walsrode. The A7 runs south for a further 14 km and the junction for the Celle route is Buchholz. The B214 from Buchholz to Celle centre is a direct route with a distance of 28 km and an average driving time of 30 minutes.\\n\\nTravelling from the north (Hamburg) is also via the A7 and the junction to the south-east of Soltau leads directly onto the B3. The B3 route to Bergen is a journey of approximately 100 km taking 1 hour through very pleasant undulating countryside.\\n\\nParking [ edit ]\\n\\nBergen predominantly has street parking. However there is additional off-street parking behind the main shopping area, accessible by taking the turning opposite the Sparkasse bank and then turning right opposite the bakery. All parking in Bergen is free.\\n\\nBy bus [ edit ]\\n\\nCeBus operates local buses from Celle to Bergen (line 100) with hourly departures on weekdays and a couple of departures on Saturday, Sunday and holidays. There is also the Entdecker Bus for tourists, which runs through the villages in the region and goes as far as Celle railway station.\\n\\nBy train [ edit ]\\n\\nBergen's railway stations are exclusively for freight. The nearest passenger train station is located in Celle and there you can connect to the main rail system with trains to the major cities of Hamburg and Hanover which is where you will also find the nearest international airports. Celle Bahnhof runs a variety of localised trains and is also a stop for the ICE trains running on the Hamburg to Hanover route. Trains to Hanover and Hamburg stop hourly at the station as do individual ICE trains during busy periods. Metronom trains link Celle to Uelzen, Hanover and Göttingen as part of the regional transport network. Celle is also the terminus for routes S6 and S7 of the Hanover S-Bahn network. Links to the east and west are not part of the structured Bahnhof system so Hanover is the better option for travelling more extensively around the area.\\n\\nBy plane [ edit ]\\n\\nThe nearest airport to Bergen is Hanover (HAJ IATA ) which is a main international airport with regular flights from most European capitals and major cities. The airport is situated in Langenhagen which is 11 km to the north of Hanover centre and has easy access to the autobahn. To Bergen is a further 55 km from Hanover airport with an estimated driving time of 55 minutes. Hanover airport is also accessible by a combination of trains, buses and taxis.\\n\\nAlso in the region is Bremen (BRE IATA ) which has many of the budget airlines operating regular flights from most European countries. The airport is located close to the city centre and there is a tram which departs every 5 to 10 minutes (on Sunday evenings up to 30 min) to Bremen city centre and the journey takes 11 min and costs €2.30. This airport is also close to the autobahn, but is 114 km and a 75-minute journey to Celle centre.\\n\\nHamburg Airport (HAM IATA ) is the nearest major airport even serving long-haul flights. From there, you can take the S-Bahn to Hamburg Hauptbahnhof, a train to Celle and a bus to Bergen like described in the sections above.\\n\\nGet around [ edit ]\\n\\nBergen is not a large town and one can walk to most places quite easily. There is no local public transport but there are plenty of taxis available. The nearest railway station is at Celle. For information on events and things going on in town, you can pick up information at the town hall (Rathaus) or go to Bergen Online; most parts of the site are in English and give details of most local events.\\n\\nThere is also the Entdecker Bus, a tourist bus running through the villages in the region going as far as Celle railway station. This is a subsidised route for the holiday season and normally runs from the end of June until mid-October, costing around €3 per person per day with children under 14 travelling free. For this, you can board/alight throughout the day at any of the predetermined stops. You may also take your bicycle as there is space allocated for them.\\n\\nSee [ edit ]\\n\\nRömstedthaus Museum\\n\\nInside the Römstedthaus Museum\\n\\nMuseums [ edit ]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHistorical sites [ edit ]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBergen-Belsen concentration camp memorial\\n\\nParks [ edit ]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChurches [ edit ]\\n\\nDo [ edit ]\\n\\nSt. Lambert's Church\\n\\nGetting around [ edit ]\\n\\nThe stops are: .

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Bergen\\n\\nBergen (Norwegian pronunciation: [ˈbæ̀rɡn̩] (listen)), historically Bjørgvin, is a city and municipality in Vestland county on the west coast of Norway. As of 2021, its population was roughly 285,600. Bergen is the second-largest city in Norway. The municipality covers 465 square kilometres (180 sq mi) and is on the peninsula of Bergenshalvøyen. The city centre and northern neighbourhoods are on Byfjorden, \\'the city fjord\\', and the city is surrounded by mountains; Bergen is known as the \"city of seven mountains\". Many of the extra-municipal suburbs are on islands. Bergen is the administrative centre of Vestland county. The city consists of eight boroughs: Arna, Bergenhus, Fana, Fyllingsdalen, Laksevåg, Ytrebygda, Årstad, and Åsane. Trading in Bergen may have started as early as the 1020s. According to tradition, the city was founded in 1070 by king Olav Kyrre and was named Bjørgvin, \\'the green meadow among the mountains\\'. It served as Norway\\'s capital in the 13th century, and from the end of the 13th century became a bureau city of the Hanseatic League. Until 1789, Bergen enjoyed exclusive rights to mediate trade between Northern Norway and abroad and it was the largest city in Norway until the 1830s when it was overtaken by the capital, Christiania (now known as Oslo). What remains of the quays, Bryggen, is a World Heritage Site. The city was hit by numerous fires over the years. The Bergen School of Meteorology was developed at the Geophysical Institute starting in 1917, the Norwegian School of Economics was founded in 1936, and the University of Bergen in 1946. From 1831 to 1972, Bergen was its own county. In 1972 the municipality absorbed four surrounding municipalities and became a part of Hordaland county. The city is an international center for aquaculture, shipping, the offshore petroleum industry and subsea technology, and a national centre for higher education, media, tourism and finance. Bergen Port is Norway\\'s busiest in terms of both freight and passengers, with over 300 cruise ship calls a year bringing nearly a half a million passengers to Bergen, a number that has doubled in 10 years. Almost half of the passengers are German or British. The city\\'s main football team is SK Brann and a unique tradition of the city is the buekorps. Natives speak a distinct dialect, known as Bergensk. The city features Bergen Airport, Flesland and Bergen Light Rail, and is the terminus of the Bergen Line. Four large bridges connect Bergen to its suburban municipalities. Bergen has a mild winter climate, though with a lot of precipitation. From December to March, Bergen can be, in rare cases, up to 20 °C warmer than Oslo, even though both cities are at about 60° North. The Gulf Stream keeps the sea relatively warm, considering the latitude, and the mountains protect the city from cold winds from the north, north-east and east.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.573818612352316, 'meta': {'url': 'https://www.definitions.net/definition/bergen', 'source_url': 'https://www.definitions.net', 'lang': 'en', 'authors': [], 'publish_date': None, 'movies_url': [], 'top_image_url': 'https://static.stands4.com/app_common/img/favicon_defn.png', 'entailment_info': {'contradiction': 0.1318795, 'neutral': 0.7763591, 'entailment': 0.0917614}}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '23fb2ee0c8dc5544798b94f133cb4a08'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': \"Bergen has a stunning natural setting, a rich cultural heritage and thriving maritime, education, media and tourism industries. Here’s everything you need to know about living in or visiting Bergen, Norway.\\n\\nNestled between mountains and with many kilometres of coastline, Bergen is a natural beauty and very much the capital of the fjord Norway region. Bergen is a city with a truly unique identity in Norway and as such, has a friendly rivalry with the capital, Oslo.\\n\\nAlthough I have never lived in Bergen, I have visited the city more than 10 times. Sometimes for work, sometimes for events and sometimes simply to wander around and see something new.\\n\\nFrom its rich history and culture to its lively atmosphere and outdoor opportunities, Bergen truly has something for everyone. Whether you're a student, professional or retiree, this complete guide will help you navigate the city and all it has to offer.\\n\\nBut this guide isn’t just for those considering a move to Bergen. I’ll also touch on plenty of information useful to those planning a trip to this west coast city. Let’s get going!\\n\\nAn introduction to Bergen\\n\\nNorway’s second largest city is home to around 288,000 people. That’s less than half of the nation’s capital, Oslo. It’s broadly equivalent to Stoke-on-Trent or Newcastle upon Tyne in the UK. For our American readers, Bergen’s size is about the same as Buffalo NY, Durham NC or Anchorage AK.\\n\\nBergen attracts tourists because of its beautiful natural setting but also its location on the coast. The city is perfectly sited for access to the fjords, so it has one of Norway’s biggest cruise ports.\\n\\nBergen has a cable car.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the city’s airport welcomes multiple daily flights from Oslo and many international destinations, while the Oslo to Bergen railway is considered by many to be one of the world’s must-do rail journeys.\\n\\nBergen’s rich history dates back to the Viking Age. The city grew quickly, most notably during its time as a member of the Hanseatic League trading network. Bergen’s economy grew on trade in fish and timber. In more recent times it became a centre of shipbuilding and maritime industries.\\n\\nBergen resources: Find a hotel – Car rental – Book tours\\n\\nThe latter remains important today, alongside tourism, as a key element of modern Bergen. Media and academia are other important elements to 21st century Bergen.\\n\\nWhere is Bergen, Norway?\\n\\nBergen is located on Norway’s west coast between Trondheim and Stavanger. It is about 300 kilometres from Oslo, as the crow flies over the Scandinavian mountains.\\n\\nBergen is the capital of Vestland, a county which comprises the former counties of Hordaland and Sogn og Fjordane. They merged to form Vestland in 2020 as part of Norway’s regional reorganisation.\\n\\nBergen is also known as the gateway to the famous Norwegian fjords. Several of Norway’s most famous fjords including the Sognefjord and Hardangerfjord are located within a few hours' drive from the city.\\n\\nFascinating facts about Bergen\\n\\nOne of the best ways to get to know a city’s personality is to discover some random facts about it.\\n\\nOf the population of 288,000, approximately 19% have an immigrant background. That means the person was either born outside of Norway, or both they were Norwegian born to foreign-born parents.\\n\\nOur list of Bergen facts includes the city’s nickname, information about the dialect spoken in Bergen, how much rain you can expect, and so much more.\\n\\nHistory of Bergen, Norway\\n\\nPerhaps more than any other Norwegian city, the history of Bergen is a fascinating one full of twists and turns. How did Bergen grow from a tiny little market town to a city of global significance? The story starts at the end of the Viking Age.\\n\\nBergen’s maritime history is still very evident in the city today.\\n\\nOlav Kyrre founded the city as Bjørgvin sometime around the year 1070. Prior to this it’s likely a trading settlement existed, but Olav gave it city status. Over the following 150 years, Bergen’s influence as a trading hub grew thanks to its favourable west coast location.\\n\\nDuring the 13th century, Bergen took over capital city status from Nidaros (now Trondheim). The construction of Bergenshus fortress began during this time, although the city’s role as capital city was a relatively short one.\\n\\nBergen’s Hanseatic Era\\n\\nAlthough Oslo became the capital city, Bergen remained Norway’s biggest city throughout the Middle Ages. Bergen had established itself as the principal source of dried cod for Europe. North Germanic traders in particular came to Bergan to buy the cod, which was sourced from Northern Norway.\\n\\nThe influence of those traders grew and Bergen went on to become a full member of the Hanseatic League in the middle of the 14th century. For the next few hundred years, Bergen largely prospered.\\n\\nBergen residents celebrate the end of the city's occupation in World War II.\\n\\nBergen in World War II\\n\\nNorway was occupied throughout almost all of the second world war. As Norway’s second biggest city and a strategic location between Germany, the UK and Northern Norway, Bergen gradually became an important stage during the conflict.\\n\\nRead more: The History of Bergen\\n\\nMoving to Bergen\\n\\nWhen you first arrive, it’s likely you’ll be dealing with the service centre for foreign workers. Known as the SUA, these centres are designed to be a one-stop shop for new residents in dealing with the authorities.\\n\\nThe SUA brings together the public services of the Police, the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) and the Tax Administration. Guidance is offered in English and several other languages.\\n\\nIn Bergen, the SUA is co-located with Skatteetaten (the Norwegian Tax Administration) at Nonnesetergaten 4. However, you can’t just turn up. You’ll need to book an appointment in advance in order to use the centre.\\n\\nLiving in Bergen\\n\\nBergen is home to tens of thousands of foreign-born residents among its population of 288,000 people. The overall population is forecast to grow to 301,200 by 2030 and 323,799 by 2050.\\n\\nThe biggest single group of foreign-born residents come from Poland, with approximately 6,800 people. There are also groups of between 1,500 and 2,250 people from Lithuania, Somalia, Iraq, Germany and Eritrea.\\n\\nThe view across Bergen from Løvstakken mountain.\\n\\nWant to listen to some local insights? Tour guide Emma Vestrheim joined our podcast in 2020 to chat about her move from Australia to Bergen and her experiences of living in the city. Listen to the show here.\\n\\nHousing options in Bergen\\n\\nAs with all Norwegian cities, there is a diverse range of accommodation options in Bergen. These range from basement bedsits known as a hybel through to full-size detached family homes.\\n\\nThe best option for you will depend on housing availability in the area in which you choose to live (more on this later), your transportation needs and your budget. Here are our guides to housing in Norway.\\n\\nThe organisation Sammen manages a large amount of student accommodation. We cover more about student housing later in the article.\\n\\nA student can expect to pay between NOK 3,000 and NOK 4,500 per month for a simple room in shared accommodation. On the private market, a room in a shared house or apartment is likely to be NOK 1,000 more. A private apartment close to the city centre will start from around NOK 9,000 per month.\\n\\nHealthcare in Bergen\\n\\nThe Norwegian healthcare system is founded on the principles of universal access, decentralisation and free choice of provider. When you first move to Norway, you will be allocated a general practitioner. This is likely to be in a medical centre with multiple doctors.\\n\\nHaukeland Hospital in Bergen, Norway. Photo: Tupungato / Shutterstock.com.\\n\\nUnhappy with your GP? Provided the medical centre of your choice has vacancies, you can register with them free of charge. You are permitted to change your registration up to twice per year.\\n\\nThe main hospital for much of western Norway is located in Bergen. Haukeland University Hospital is located in the Årstad, a short drive south of the city centre. The recent extension to the city’s light rail serves the hospital.\\n\\nPeople travel from all over Vestland county for appointments at the hospital. It is also one of the city's biggest employers. Haukeland is a national resource centre for burn injuries, air-pressure injuries from diving, certain eye surgeries and brain tumours.\\n\\nDistricts of Bergen\\n\\nBergen municipality splits the city into the following districts: Arna, Bergenhus, Fana, Fyllingsdalen, Laksevågen, Ytrebygda, Årstad, and Åsane. Which of these you live in will effect where you get certain public services from, including the welfare office.\\n\\nWithin each of these administrative districts are areas with better-known names, however.\\n\\nFor example, Bergenhus covers most of downtown Bergen but also the Sandviken area to the northeast. Sandviken is well-known for its large, wooden houses and is home to a mix of people from families to students. There are also many residential homes on the Nordnes peninsula.\\n\\nNygårdshøyden is known as student central in Bergen. As well as being home to the university, Nygårdshøyden is the first choice for many students seeking accommodation in Bergen. A home here is walking distance from the university and the central area.\\n\\nAn area of much development in the 1960s and 1970s, Fyllingsdalen is an urban residential neighbourhood recently connected to the city centre by the new light rail line. There are many borettslag housing developments in the area.\\n\\nThe Sælemyr and Lyshovden borettslag housing developments in Fyllingsdalen, Bergen. Photo: Bergen Kommune.\\n\\nHome to important cultural heritage and previously an agricultural district, Åsane has been largely developed over the past decades. It is home to the city's main prison and a large IKEA store.\\n\\nWorking in Bergen\\n\\nIf you’re planning to move to Bergen, you likely already have a job offer or at least a job in mind. But perhaps you’re earlier in your relocation journey and wondering what options there are in the city.\\n\\nAs with all Norwegian cities, the public sector is a major employer. However, gaining employment in this sector generally requires good Norwegian language skills, something that will take many months if not years to obtain.\\n\\nOther important industries in Bergen are media and the maritime industry. The Port of Bergen is the most important maritime hub on the west coast and is one of the most popular cruise destinations in Northern Europe.\\n\\nThe University of Bergen and related research institutes are also important employers, particularly of foreign researchers. The university employs more than 4,200 faculty and staff, and about half of graduating doctors are from outside Norway.\\n\\nStudent life in Bergen\\n\\nClaiming to be the most cited university in Norway, the University of Bergen (UiB) hosts almost 20,000 students across its seven faculties:\\n\\nFine Art, Music and Design\\n\\nHumanities\\n\\nLaw\\n\\nMathematics and Natural Sciences\\n\\nMedicine\\n\\nPsychology\\n\\nSocial Sciences\\n\\nUiB International Centre is an important service for international students and staff. They also run seminars on diverse topics including paying tax in Norway and an introduction course for new employees.\\n\\nSmall Botanical Garden at the University of Bergen Museum.\\n\\nThere are around 170 groups and societies serving the student population of Bergen. Everything from sports, arts, politics and entrepreneurship is represented, so you are sure to find something of interest for you if you are a news student in the city. They are a great way of meeting new people and improving your Norwegian skills.\\n\\nMost international students live in accommodation owned by Sammen. Around 4,000 accommodation units, mainly single or double rooms but also some studios and larger apartments designed for families, are managed by Sammen. Typical monthly prices range from NOK 3,000 to 4,500.\\n\\nThe suburb of Fantoft is home to many international students. Here you'll find Samoan's largest residential units, home to some 1,100 students.\\n\\nPublic transportation in Bergen\\n\\nDo you need a car to live in Bergen? Not necessarily. While a car is always useful especially with a family, Bergen’s public transportation could be a good solution for you, depending on where you live.\\n\\nThere are two light rail lines, known locally as Bybanen, plus an extensive network of local buses. It is coordinated by Skyss. At the time of writing, single tickets for the central zone cost 40kr in advance. A monthly pass costs 755kr.\\n\\nThe first light rail line runs from downtown Bergen all the way out to the airport. The new second line connects central Bergen with Haukeland Hospital and the Fyllingsdalen neighbourhood.\\n\\nBybanen, the light rail system in Bergen.\\n\\nDownloading the Skyss app to find bus routes, timetables and buy tickets is a must-do for new residents. Tourists may also find the app the easiest way to use the city's public transport system.\\n\\nRead more: Public transport in Bergen\\n\\nLandmarks of Bergen\\n\\nWhether you are a new resident or visiting the city as a tourist, Bergen’s landmarks are important ways to get to know the city.\\n\\nUNESCO World Heritage site Bryggen\\n\\nFor centuries, these colorful former trading houses were the driver of Bergen’s economy as a key part of the Hanseatic League.\\n\\nBergen resources: Find a hotel – Car rental – Book tours\\n\\nWhereas Bergen’s success was built on trading Norwegian cod for grain, salt and textiles, today you’re more likely to find troll trinkets and postcards. However, hidden down the alleyways are much more interesting galleries, many filled with artwork from locals.\\n\\nMount Fløyen\\n\\nBergen is known for its mountainous surroundings. The best known of these is Fløyen. It’s far from the biggest, but it’s the most accessible thanks to the Fløibanen funicular railway that links Fløyen with downtown Bergen.\\n\\nBergen Fish Market\\n\\nSince the early Middle Ages, Bergen’s fish market has been an important meeting place for fishermen, merchants and shoppers.\\n\\nToday, a large indoor food hall hosts a year-round fish market and restaurants, while there are stalls outside that are open for most of the year.\\n\\nFantoft Stave Church\\n\\nRebuilt in the traditional style following a 1992 fire, this wooden church is a wonderful example of stave architecture.\\n\\nFantoft stave church in Bergen, Norway.\\n\\nBuilt sometime around 1150, the original church actually stood in Fortun in Sogn. To prevent its destruction, the church was relocated piece-by-piece to its present location in 1883.\\n\\nThe Blue Stone\\n\\nA sculpture by artist Asbjørn Andresen, the Blue Stone is the default meeting place for many people in central Bergen. Situated at Kong Olav Vs plass by Hotel Norge, the angled concrete sculpture is covered in slabs of blue Brazilian sodalite stone.\\n\\nOther key Bergen landmarks include Mount Ulriken and Bergenhus fortress.\\n\\nHiking in Bergen\\n\\nOne of the most popular things to do in Bergen—especially for locals—is hiking. If you want to quickly feel at home in Bergen, meet local people and make friends, strap on your hiking boots and start exploring.\\n\\nMount Fløyen is the starting point for many hikes, which is why there’s so many locals using the Fløibanen funicular early on weekends. Many trails are signed, with most starting out past the cafe and playground.\\n\\nFløyen is also the start or end point of the famous hike between the top of the Fløibanen funicular and the cable car over on Mount Ulriken. This hike is not for the inexperienced, but it offers tremendous views across the city and its surroundings.\\n\\nRead more: Hiking in Bergen\\n\\nWhat’s on in Bergen\\n\\nThroughout the year, Bergen plays host to festivals and events that celebrate the unique character of the city.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Learn the ins and outs of visiting Bergen, Norway with valuable information that will help you hit the ground running!\\n\\nSituated in the middle of the mountains and fjords of Norway is the quaint city of Bergen. From its small city vibe to its perfect natural setting, visiting Bergen should be on everybody’s Norway bucket list.\\n\\nRead on to understand what makes it such a beautiful city and all the things you need to know before traveling to Bergen, Norway, from the weather to the currency and what to do while you’re there. Let’s get started!\\n\\nDisclosure: Some of the links below may be affiliate links. At no additional cost to you, I may earn a small commission if you make a purchase.\\n\\nIntroduction to Bergen, Norway\\n\\nFounded in 1070, Bergen was the biggest town in Norway until the 1830s. It was a major European trade and sea port and part of the Hanseatic League – a commercial cooperation in Europe. The Hanseatic merchants helped put Bergen on the map originally as it was a giant export of fish products in the Middle Ages.\\n\\nVisiting Bergen, Norway today offers unique opportunities for everyone from the outdoorsy to the city folks and from the foodies to the cultural travelers. Often called the “Fjord Capital of Norway” and “the city between the seven mountains”, you’ll instantaneously be charmed by the charming city and its scenic location in the heart of the fjords.\\n\\nNot to mention, the city center of Bergen is compact, requiring only about 15 minutes to really travel from one end of the city to another. Let’s dive into the details about visiting Bergen and what you can expect of the second largest city in Norway!\\n\\n1. How to Travel to Bergen\\n\\nYou can travel to Bergen via a number of different modes of transportation. You can rent a car and drive, or stop in Bergen by boat, but I recommend taking public transit, such as a plane or a train. Both these modes of transportation will help you arrive to central Bergen quickly and cost effectively.\\n\\nArrive by Plane\\n\\nIf traveling by plane, you will arrive at Bergen Airport Flesland, located 19km south of the city. The Bergen airport code is BGO.\\n\\nFrom the airport, you can take public transport to get into the city. The airport bus service, Flybussen, is a quick 30 minute journey costing NOK 159 one-way if bought in advance. Or, you can take the light-rail system, Bybanen, for a 45 minute journey costing only NOK 30.\\n\\nBoth run frequently, about every 15 minutes, and will take you into the Bergen city center. There is also of course, the option to take a taxi from the Bergen airport, but it will run you closer to NOK400 – 500\\n\\nTake the Train\\n\\nComing from Oslo to Bergen, taking the train is the best option. It will take about 7 hours to cross the country, but it provides insanely scenic views. Make sure to grab a seat by the window!\\n\\nIf you have extra time in your Norwegian itinerary, you can also do the scenic “Norway in a Nutshell” journey. This train and fjord adventure takes you through the mountains, fjords, and waterfalls that make Norway one of the most beautiful countries in the world.\\n\\nLearn how to do the Norway in a Nutshell journey without a tour!\\n\\nTransportation around Bergen\\n\\nBergen has a fairly small city center which then spreads into the hillsides. This makes it easy to explore the city center by foot. In fact, walking is the best way to get around town. It will only take you about 15 minutes to walk from one end of town to the next.\\n\\nIf you’re interested in the public transit in Bergen, you can stop by the Bergen Tourist Information office next to Fisketorget in downtown Bergen to purchase tickets for the busses and light-rail. Alternatively, you can travel on the light-rail and busses for free if you purchase the Bergen Card.\\n\\n2. When to Visit Bergen, Norway\\n\\nLocated in southwestern Norway, you’ll find that the days in Bergen greatly vary in length throughout the year. If you visit Bergen in the summer, you’ll have about 19 hours of daylight, but visit Bergen in winter and you’ll be limited to under 6 hours of daylight! This of course will impact how much you’ll be able to see each day in Bergen – particularly if you want to take in the beautiful scenery in the area.\\n\\nSimilarly, if you are interested in hiking around Bergen, plan to visit in summer. Some of the most popular Norwegian hikes are only accessible from June to September due to the amount of snow some regions in Norway get. That being said, the city of Bergen is more likely to get rain than snow, making winter an acceptable time to visit Bergen.\\n\\nTo find your ideal time to visit Bergen, let’s talk a little bit more about the weather in Bergen…\\n\\n3. Weather in Bergen\\n\\nWhat surprised me most about Bergen? The weather. Throughout a day in Bergen, it can go from sunny and “warm” to freezing rain to overcast and windy to snowing and then back again. Fortunately, the weather comes and goes quickly. This means you’ll want to wear layers and always carry a coat.\\n\\nYou’re also quite likely to encounter rain during your trip to Bergen as this beautiful city typically receives 200 days of rain per year. That’s right, rain, not snow, so pack an umbrella and rain boots – no matter what time of year you’re visiting Bergen!\\n\\nYou’ll definitely end up getting to know some of the amazing indoor sights around Bergen if you stay long enough.\\n\\nFind more details in the Best Time to Visit Bergen: Deep Dive into the Seasons of Bergen\\n\\n4. The Cost of Visiting Bergen\\n\\nNorway is expensive. In fact, it’s one of the most expensive places to travel to in the world! Fortunately, Bergen is a bit less expensive than Oslo and there are plenty of free things to do in Bergen to help keep your costs down. However, make sure to leave some extra room in your trip budget for Norway – as you are sure to need it!\\n\\nYou are likely to encounter unexpectedly high prices for food, accommodations, tours, and entry fees. In fact, it’s common to find beers costing over $10 USD and a typical meal coming in around $30 USD.\\n\\nTo get a better idea of the cost of Norway, budget out some of the big ticket items, like hotels on Booking.com or tours available on Viator and Get Your Guide. This will make up the bulk of your trip cost and help you better plan ahead.\\n\\nReview 44 Pro Tips to Save Money While Traveling to help make your trip to Bergen more affordable.\\n\\n5. Currency in Norway\\n\\nAs Norway is not part of the European Union, it does not operate on the Euro. The Norwegian currency is the Norwegian krone. You’ll see the currency code listed as NOK and the symbok as “kr”. You’ll find coins come in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 20 and banknotes come as 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 kroner.\\n\\nWhile most places in Norway do accept credit and debit cards now, you will also want to visit an ATM to have some krones on hand for the instances where credit and debit are not accepted.\\n\\n6. Where to Stay in Bergen\\n\\nBeing a pretty small city, you’ll want to stay centrally to easily walk from sight to sight in the city. This will allow you to effortlessly explore the city and really take advantage of all of the activities in Bergen.\\n\\nHere are recommendations for hotels in Bergen to fit any price range, all located within the city center:\\n\\nBudget Accommodation: City Hostel Bergen – offers affordable private rooms and even less expensive dorm rooms\\n\\nFind the best areas and hotels to stay in around Bergen.\\n\\n7. What to Do in Bergen\\n\\nThere are a lot of things to do in Bergen and even more options in the surrounding mountains and fjords. Here are some of the top things you’ll want to consider for your time sightseeing in Bergen.\\n\\nMeander through Bryggen, a UNESCO World Heritage site, which features the classic wooden houses of Norway.\\n\\nHave lunch at the Bergen fish market.

What to Buy in Bergen\\n\\nSouvenir shopping can be a big thing for many travelers. Like many tourist friendly cities, you’ll find shopping in Bergen to be a pleasure – if you can stomach the high prices!\\n\\nAs you explore the city, you’ll find classic Norwegian souvenirs, like trolls, Viking souvenirs, Nordic caviar, traditional Norwegian costumes (bunads), handmade sweaters, and handicrafts. Stop by Vagsallmenningen, the leading gift shop in Bergen, for your souvenir needs.\\n\\nChoose from the main pedestrian streets for shopping, like Strandgaten, Marken, and Torgallmenningen, or try out one of the many major department stores, like Galleriet or Bergen Storsenter. You’ll find loads of clothes, antiques, ceramics, jewelry, and more. You’re sure to find the perfect Bergen souvenir!\\n\\n9. Staying Safe in Bergen\\n\\nIs Bergen safe? Overall, Norway is a wealthy and safe country with very low crime rates, and Bergen is no exception. Of course, you should always be attentive to your surroundings, but as a solo female traveler, I felt 100% safe in Bergen.\\n\\nI do however, still suggest having travel insurance to handle any unexpected disruptions to your trip. I always travel with World Nomads travel insurance. This just gives you peace of mind and really allows you to enjoy your trip to Norway.\\n\\nRead 35 Critical Safety Tips for Solo Female Travelers\\n\\n10. Is Bergen worth visiting?\\n\\nBergen is definitely worth visiting as a part of your trip to Norway. It’s close proximity to the fjords and coast make it a stunning city and a great base for a few days. You’ll also find it varies greatly from some of the other prime tourist attractions in Norway.\\n\\nHowever, if you are more interested in city sights than natural beauty, Bergen is likely not it. The city itself is very quaint and does not offer as many sightseeing opportunities as many of the larger cities throughout Europe, like Paris, Rome, or Barcelona.\\n\\nCheck out the many reasons to visit Bergen.\\n\\n11. How many days do you need in Bergen?\\n\\nHow many days you want to spend in Bergen will largely depend on what your interests are. I recommend you spend at least 2 days in the Bergen area with one day to explore the city center and one day in the Norwegian fjords.\\n\\nIf you like hiking, you should add on at least one more day. Also, if you want to see every museum in Bergen, you could easily spend one to two days just on that, so add a couple more days.\\n\\nSee the Perfect Two Day Itinerary for Visiting Bergen\\n\\nPlan More of Your Trip around Norway\\n\\nNow that you are prepped with the key things to know when visiting Bergen, it’s time to plan more of your trip to Norway!

       "  <Document: {'content': \"A city known for its stunning setting, rich cultural history, and charming Scandinavian ambiance, Bergen is a must-do when visiting Norway. Here’s our suggestions for the best things to do in Bergen, Norway.\\n\\nLocated on Norway’s west coast, Bergen is the second-largest city in Norway and one of the most popular destinations for travellers seeking an authentic Norwegian experience.\\n\\nThe iconic wharf buildings of Bryggen in Bergen, Norway.\\n\\nKnown as the gateway to the fjords, the city is used as a base for many people planning to visit the famous waterways. Yet Bergen stands apart as a destination in itself, whether you’re into history, culture, food or outdoor experiences.\\n\\nAlthough I’ve only lived in Oslo and Trondheim in Norway, I’ve been to Bergen countless times for events, family trips and simply to spend some time in the city. I’ve gotten to know the city really well, so if you’re thinking of visiting Bergen, this is the article for you.\\n\\nAn introduction to Bergen\\n\\nAs Norway’s second largest city, Bergen is home to around 280,000 people. Its natural setting surrounded by mountains and water makes it one of Norway’s most picturesque cities, despite its size.\\n\\nBergen also attracts tourists because of the charms of the city itself, its proximity to the fjords, its large cruise port and its accessibility. Bergen Airport Flesland is served by multiple daily flights from Oslo and many international destinations, while the Bergen Line railway is world famous.\\n\\nBergen has a rich history that dates back to the Viking Age. Founded in the year 1070 by King Olav Kyrre, Bergen grew quickly, soon becoming an important centre of trade for the entire west coast. Its membership of the Hanseatic League saw the city become a European trading hub notably in fish and timber.\\n\\nBergen has a lot of waterfront neighbourhoods.\\n\\nToday, Bergen is a thriving centre of industry, education and culture. The maritime industry remains a major player while tourism is important too. On that note, let’s take a look at the top things to in Bergen.\\n\\nThere’s so much to do in Bergen\\n\\nBergen is the perfect starting point to explore the best of Norwegian nature. But travellers should make sure to spend at least some time in the city before moving on.\\n\\nBergen travel resources: Find a hotel – Car rental – Book tours\\n\\nWhy? Well, from a UNESCO World Heritage site at the very heart of the city to a funicular railway that gives you an incredible panoramic view in just a few minutes, Bergen is packed with must-see sights. Let’s dive right in!\\n\\nUNESCO World Heritage site Bryggen\\n\\n1. Historic Bryggen: The waterfront Bryggen district has managed to retain its distinctive character and charm despite several fires and hundreds of years of change to the city around it. Its origins date back to the 14th century when German traders moved into Bergen and the city joined the Hanseatic League.\\n\\nThe trading buildings and warehouses were built with traditional wooden construction methods. Importantly, reconstruction and renovation has been carried out using those same methods, something which is key to its status as a World Heritage site.\\n\\nMany visitors to Bergen take a quick photo of the famous colourful buildings and move on. That’s such a shame! Spend must a few minutes exploring the narrow alleyways and courtyards and you’ll appreciate the area so much more.\\n\\nThe colourful trading houses of Bryggen in Bergen.\\n\\nOne thing I like about the neighbourhood is that it’s still a trading district today. Several independent boutiques and small cafes are hidden away down the narrow alleyways, another great reason to spend a little time exploring.\\n\\nMount Fløyen\\n\\nDespite it being one of Norway’s biggest cities, Bergen is still full of nature lovers. Why? You’ll soon figure it out! The city is surrounded by mountains, full of hiking trails galore.\\n\\n2: Ride Fløibanen: This funicular railway whisks visitors from the city centre up to the top of Mount Fløyen in just a few minutes. The reward? The phenomenal view of the city and its surroundings.\\n\\nThere’s much more to Fløyen than just the viewpoint at the top of the funicular, so make sure to allow time to explore the surrounding area. At the very least, wander down past the restaurant to meet the goats who call this area their home!\\n\\nWhen I’m in town, I prefer to take the train no later than mid-morning for the quietest experience. If you’re spending more than a few hours in the city, consider going up in the evening. It’s less crowded and the view is no less spectacular.\\n\\n3. Hike round Fløyen: While up at Fløyen, why not do as the locals do? While tourists rush to the viewing platforms, locals head straight for the hiking trails.\\n\\nFriendly goats call Bergen’s mount Fløyen their home.\\n\\nThere’s something for everyone here, from a gentle stroll to an all-day hike across the mountain ridge to Ulriken. For a short walk with a nice reward, follow the signs for the short 10-15 minute trip to lake Skomakerdiket. During the summer there is free canoe rental at the lake.\\n\\n4. Troll Forest: Also allow a few minutes to explore Trollskogen, the troll forest hidden behind the Fløyen service buildings. Here you’ll find various wooden troll sculptures amongst the trees that kids will love discovering.\\n\\nIt’s a good alternative to experience some nature if you don’t have time for a hike. Curious to learn more? I've recorded this YouTube video to give you a tour.\\n\\nBergenhus Fortress\\n\\n5. Explore the fortress grounds: Between the cruise ship port and Bryggen you’ll find the impressive grounds of Bergenhus fortress. Originally a garrison with a tower acting as the royal residence and a large banqueting hall, this site is a former protector of the coastal city.\\n\\nBergen travel resources: Find a hotel – Car rental – Book tours\\n\\nHowever, the fortress grounds are better known today as an outdoor festival venue. Major concerts, festivals and events take place here throughout the year.\\n\\nA reminder of the city’s importance during the Middle Ages, Rosenkrantz Tower is one of Scandinavia’s best Renaissance-era monuments. Haakons Hall is the largest secular building from the medieval era in Norway.\\n\\nDowntown Bergen\\n\\n6. Bergen Fish Market: Since the 12th century, the city’s fish market has been the meeting place for merchants, fishermen and hungry visitors.\\n\\nFood hall at Bergen Fish Market.\\n\\nToday there is a large indoor fish market and food hall that’s open all year round, while the outdoor market is open for most of the year except for the winter.\\n\\nYou can find fresh fish and seafood and local farmers market style food, perfect if you’re staying In self catered accommodation. But there are also restaurants at in the indoor food hall and takeaway options outside if you just want to grab a quick bite to eat.\\n\\n7. Bergen Cathedral: The earliest known historical records of Bergen cathedral dates from the year 1181. It’s been destroyed by fire, rebuilt and renovated several times, most recently in the 1880s.\\n\\nWhat makes this cathedral quite different from any other in Norway is the cannonball embedded in the exterior wall. It is from a sea battle between the English and Dutch fleets during the Battle of Vågen in 1665, part of the Second Anglo-Dutch war.\\n\\n8. Bergen Aquarium: The aquarium was founded to share knowledge about Norwegian marine fauna but today hosts all manner of exotic fish, reptiles and even penguins.\\n\\nOpen every day from 10am to 6pm, it’s a popular family attraction for the city. To get there you can walk along the Nordnes peninsula or take the Beffen ferry…\\n\\n9. Ride the Beffen ferry: The historic (and tiny!) Beffen passenger ferry has operated for more than 120 years around the harbours of Bergen. Today it’s mostly a tourist service, serving the Fish Market, the Nordnes peninsula for the aquarium and Sandviken. The latter stop is ideal for visiting the Fisheries museum and Old Bergen museum.\\n\\nMuseums in Bergen\\n\\n10. Bryggens museum: No tour of Bryggen is complete without a visit to Bryggens Museum to gain more insight into the area’s history. This is especially so during this period when the Hanseatic museum is closed for renovation.\\n\\nThe permanent exhibition at Bryggens museum showcases the archaeological discoveries from the 1950s dig that would eventually save the district. Beyond the district, there is an exhibition on the impact of World War II in Bergen, and a look back at Bergen’s time as one of Europe’s most important trading centres during the Middle Ages.\\n\\n11. KODE Bergen Art Museum: The city’s lake Lille Lingegårdsvannet is well-worth a walk if the weather is nice.\\n\\nKODE Art Museum and the city lake Lille Lingegårdsvannet.\\n\\nOn one side of the lake you’ll find the four buildings of Bergen’s Art Museum KODE. It’s one of Scandinavia’s largest such museums and as such, offers a diverse look at art history from around the world.\\n\\nVisitors can admire works from world-famous artists including Picasso and Miró. There’s also plenty of focus on Norwegian artists. Works from the Norwegian romantic era including the fjord landscapes of Nikolai Astrup are on display.\\n\\n12. Leprosy museum: This is perhaps one of the most unusual places on the list, but bear with me! What used to be a leprosy hospital is now a memorial to this terrible disease and a showcase for scientific progress.\\n\\nAlso known in some parts of the world as Hansen’s disease, leprosy is a long-term bacterial infection that has affected humanity for thousands of years. What has this got to do with Bergen? Well, at one point, Bergen was a European centre for research into the condition.\\n\\nA visit to Bergen's leprosy museum is not a thrilling experience but it is an educational one. On your visit, be sure to visit the small church adjacent to the hospital. Ask the staff if it’s open. Here, both patients and the public attended services, although they sat in different parts of the church and used different entrances.\\n\\n13. University Museum of Bergen: Natural history comes under the spotlight in the university museum. Items on display range from the Age of antiquity right through to today, featuring specimens of animals, fungi, plants and minerals from the university’s vast collection.\\n\\nThere’s a focus on what we have learned from the sea bed but also from the western Norway region. For example, visitors can study the world’s oldest known example of the Hardanger fiddle, an important part of Norwegian folk music history.\\n\\nStatue near the University Museum of Bergen. Photo credit: Vachonya / Shutterstock.com.\\n\\n14. Maritime museum: The maritime industry has long been an important part of Bergen’s economy and culture all along the Norwegian coastline. Bergen’s maritime museum chronicles this history and showcases some fascinating archaeological finds.\\n\\nThe development in shipbuilding techniques is presented, sure to be of interest to anyone with an interest in ships and sailing. There’s also an exhibition covering the stories of many Norwegian vessels that were engaged during battles in World War II.\\n\\n15. Bergen science centre: Although aimed at children, you can let your inner child run free at Bergen science centre.\\n\\nBergen travel resources: Find a hotel – Car rental – Book tours\\n\\nHighlights include a look at the human body and the interactive energy zone. If you do travel with children, they can produce their own weather report and learn about the ocean through wave machines and ship simulators.\\n\\nFrom the city centre, walk through the park Nygårdsparken to reach the interactive museum.\\n\\n16. Gamle Bergen museum: This open-air museum takes visitors back to Bergen as it was in the 19th century, when Bergen was one of Europe’s biggest wooden cities with plenty of busy public squares.\\n\\nSeveral of the buildings at the museum are open to visit including the former pharmacy, while actors play the roles of masters and servants in comedic “slice of life” performances throughout the day.\\n\\nActors performing at Gamle Bergen museum.\\n\\nGrab a map to make sure you don’t miss any of the open buildings and alleyways. One word of warning though! If you’re the kind of person who gets squeamish at the dentist, you may want to prepare yourself before visiting the dentist’s house!\\n\\nCountry estates of Bergen\\n\\nOne downside of Bergen’s status as Norway’s biggest city cruise port is that the downtown district can get very busy during summer. There is some respite available, however, out in the city suburbs.\\n\\n17. Edvard Grieg’s former home: It’s impossible to miss the importance of Edvard Grieg’s legacy in Bergen. The world-famous Norwegian composer is celebrated throughout the city, from several states to a concert hall in his name.\\n\\nIf you’re interested in finding out more about Grieg, his music or his legacy, head to Troldhaugen. The villa and country estate formerly home to Grieg is now a museum and a home for regular recitals.\\n\\n18. Gamlehaugen royal residence: The official vacation residence of the Norwegian royal family in Bergen, Gamlehaugen can be visited during the summer months on a guided tour.\\n\\nThe building’s first floor has been converted into a museum devoted to the memory of Christian Michelsen, Norway’s first prime minister and the last private owner of Gamlehaugen.\\n\\nThe striking exterior of Gamlehaugen.\\n\\n19. Damsgård country house: This smart 18th-century wooden rococo building is one of the finest examples of the style in Europe. Around the time it was built, Bergen’s elite spent their time and money building luxury countryside retreats. At one point there were 70 of these mansions outside Bergen.\\n\\nDamsgård was one of the best examples. The lavish home features a fully-restored ballroom, which you can see as part of a guided tour. Another enjoyable part of your visit will be wandering through the pleasure gardens, recreated in the 1980s as it was 200 years before.\\n\\nChurches in Bergen\\n\\nI already mentioned Bergen cathedral, but there are many other religious buildings of note in and around the city.\\n\\n20. Fantoft stave church: Many of Norway’s magnificent stave churches are difficult to visit without a car. Traditionally built outside of villages, many of the stave churches still standing are in rural locations around the fjord region.\\n\\nHowever, a short ride from downtown Bergen on the light rail system is Fantoft Stave Church. This remarkable wooden church was relocated piece-by-piece from a fjord village to Bergen in the 19th century in order to preserve it.\\n\\nThe church was burned to the ground in 1992 in an arson attack, but it was then rebuilt as close as possible to the original design, so what stands now is even more impressive.\\n\\nFantoft Stave Church is a short trip from central Bergen.\\n\\nThe church is only actually open for a few hours a day during high season, but it’s still worth a visit at any time of year. The forest setting means there are many vantage points of this wonderful building.\\n\\n21. St. Mary’s church: Bergen’s oldest building is a fine example of Romanesque architecture. Believed to date from between 1130 and 1170, the church is in basilica style, relatively rare for a Norwegian parish church.\\n\\nEasy to visit just behind the end of Bryggen, the church is worth a look for its unique rococo-style pulpit and altarpiece, likely from Lübeck, and commemorative paintings.\\n\\n22. St John’s church: A landmark in the city, St. John’s Church (Johanneskirken) is home to Bergen’s tallest church tower. That, coupled with its hilltop location, means the 19th-century neo-Gothic church is easy to spot from the pedestrian streets of downtown Bergen.\\n\\nThe church can house more than 1,000 people and often hosts organ recitals in the summer and Christmas concerts in December.\\n\\nShopping in Bergen\\n\\n23. Marken: The boutiques and independent stores lining the cobbled street Marken makes it one of the more interesting shopping districts in the city. It’s just a few steps from the city lake and the light rail terminus.\\n\\nAre you arriving into Bergen by train? Then you’ll find the street directly opposite the station entrance, and it’s an ideal short-cut to the city centre and Bryggen areas.\\n\\n24. Bryggen’s Christmas shop: I mentioned earlier the boutiques in the Bryggen district. But in the front of one of the main buildings you’ll find the Christmas store. Surprisingly, this is a Christmas store that is open all year round.\\n\\nSo no matter when you visit Bergen, Julehuset gives you a chance to experience traditional Scandinavian festive decorations, and even buy some for yourself if you want to add a Norwegian touch to your own celebrations back home.\\n\\nChristmas in Bergen\\n\\nWhile we’re on the topic of Christmas…! The festive season is an intriguing time to visit the city.\\n\\n25. Pepperkakebyen: Bergen’s gingerbread town is truly an assault on the senses. As you can see in this video, it looks amazing. But I can promise you that it smells even better!\\n\\nBergen's gingerbread town.\\n\\nMade every year by local schoolchildren, community groups, and local companies, the gingerbread town is open from mid-November until the end of the year.\\n\\nHighlights for me were the gingerbread version of the city’s football stadium, the riverboats, and the trains making their way around the gingerbread town. If you are visiting Bergen in the run-up to Christmas, a trip to Pepperkakebyen is an absolute must.\\n\\n26. Bergen Christmas Market: The scent of roasted almonds and the sweet taste of gløgg—a trip to Bergen completes the sensory overload at Christmas time! Every year, Festplassen is transformed into a festive wonderland full of wooden stalls selling everything from food and drink to handmade gifts.\\n\\nGetting out and about\\n\\nIf you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading! As I said at the very beginning, Bergen is a wonderful base to use for tours around the fjord region. Here are some of the best.\\n\\nBergen travel resources: Find a hotel – Car rental – Book tours\\n\\n27. Rødne fjord cruise: If you’re not planning to visit the famous fjords during your visit to Norway, this relatively short sightseeing cruise could be for you. It’s the perfect way to get a taster of fjord landscape without the days needed for a ‘proper’ trip.\\n\\nWhile the 3.5-hour roundtrip doesn’t visit the famous fjords, it does visit the wonderful nature of the Osterfjord and sails through the narrow Mostraumen straits. Best of all? It’s available year-round.\\n\\n28. Norway coastal voyage: Since 1893, cargo and passenger vessels have sailed along the Norwegian coast on a scheduled service, most of the time from Bergen.\\n\\nWhile today’s operators Hurtigruten and Havila still carry both cargo and local passengers, they are best-known for their Bergen-Kirkenes-Bergen roundtrip voyages, known by people in the know as BKB.\\n\\nMost days, a vessel leaves Bergen in the late afternoon to set out on its epic 11-day voyage to Kirkenes and back. You don’t have to do full the trip. Both companies offer shorter voyages such as Bergen to Trondheim, while port-to-port booking is also possible.\\n\\n29. Oslo to Bergen railway: If you’re wondering how to travel between Norway’s capital city Oslo and the coastal city Bergen, then you should at least consider the railway.\\n\\nThe Bergen Line covers a distance of approximately 496 kilometers, and its highest point, Finse, is located 1,222 meters above sea level. It’s widely considered to be one of the world’s most scenic train journeys, soaring high over the Hardangervidda mountain plateau.\\n\\nThe railway was constructed in the late 19th century and was completed in 1909. It was built to connect the capital city of Oslo with the coastal city of Bergen, and it was an important transportation route for both people and goods.\\n\\nToday it’s just as popular with tourists as it is with local Norwegian passengers and there are several daily departures in both directions.\\n\\nOther things to do in Bergen\\n\\nOf course, there are many more things to do in Bergen.

About 1100 a castle was built on the northern edge of Vågen harbour, and Bergen became commercially and politically important; it was Norway’s capital in the 12th and 13th centuries. An episcopal see was established there in the 12th century. A trade centre for centuries, Bergen exported fish and furs and imported grain and manufactured goods. In the 14th century, German Hanseatic merchants acquired control over the city’s trade; their influence in a weakened Norway lasted into the 17th century. Bergen has remained the most important port on the west coast of Norway, despite its repeated destruction by fire (most notably in 1702 and 1916); wider streets and buildings of brick and stone have been built in response to these disasters.\\n\\nBergen is now the second largest city in Norway. It has developed a diversified economy, based largely on fishing, shipbuilding and associated industries (repairing and equipment), machinery and metal products, and food processing. Tourism has also grown in importance. Notable buildings are the 12th-century St. Mary’s Church, the city’s oldest structure; Bergenhus fortress, including Håkonshallen (Haakon’s Hall, built in the 13th century); and the Rosenkrantz Tower.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'City and municipality in Vestland, Norway\\n\\nThis article is about the city in Norway. For other uses, see Bergen (disambiguation)\\n\\nCity and municipality in Western Norway, Norway\\n\\nBergen ( Norwegian pronunciation: [ˈbæ̀rɡn̩] ()), historically Bjørgvin, is a city and municipality in Vestland county on the west coast of Norway. As of 2021 , its population is roughly 285,900.[2] Bergen is the second-largest city in Norway after national capital Oslo. The municipality covers 465 square kilometres (180 sq mi) and is on the peninsula of Bergenshalvøyen. The city centre and northern neighbourhoods are on Byfjorden, \\'the city fjord\\', and the city is surrounded by mountains; Bergen is known as the \"city of seven mountains\". Many of the extra-municipal suburbs are on islands. Bergen is the administrative centre of Vestland county. The city consists of eight boroughs: Arna, Bergenhus, Fana, Fyllingsdalen, Laksevåg, Ytrebygda, Årstad, and Åsane.\\n\\nTrading in Bergen may have started as early as the 1020s. According to tradition, the city was founded in 1070 by King Olav Kyrre and was named Bjørgvin, \\'the green meadow among the mountains\\'. It served as Norway\\'s capital in the 13th century, and from the end of the 13th century became a bureau city of the Hanseatic League. Until 1789, Bergen enjoyed exclusive rights to mediate trade between Northern Norway and abroad and it was the largest city in Norway until the 1830s when it was overtaken by the capital, Christiania (now known as Oslo). What remains of the quays, Bryggen, is a World Heritage Site. The city was hit by numerous fires over the years. The Bergen School of Meteorology was developed at the Geophysical Institute starting in 1917, the Norwegian School of Economics was founded in 1936, and the University of Bergen in 1946. From 1831 to 1972, Bergen was its own county. In 1972 the municipality absorbed four surrounding municipalities and became a part of Hordaland county.\\n\\nThe city is an international center for aquaculture, shipping, the offshore petroleum industry and subsea technology, and a national centre for higher education, media, tourism and finance. Bergen Port is Norway\\'s busiest in terms of both freight and passengers, with over 300 cruise ship calls a year bringing nearly a half a million passengers to Bergen,[3] a number that has doubled in 10 years.[4] Almost half of the passengers are German or British.[4] The city\\'s main football team is SK Brann and a unique tradition of the city is the buekorps. Natives speak a distinct dialect, known as Bergensk. The city features Bergen Airport, Flesland and Bergen Light Rail, and is the terminus of the Bergen Line. Four large bridges connect Bergen to its suburban municipalities.\\n\\nBergen has a mild winter climate, though with a lot of precipitation. From December to March, Bergen can, in rare cases, be up to 20 °C warmer than Oslo, even though both cities are at about 60° North. In summer however, Bergen is several degrees cooler than Oslo due to the same maritime effects. The Gulf Stream keeps the sea relatively warm, considering the latitude, and the mountains protect the city from cold winds from the north, north-east and east.\\n\\nHistory [ edit ]\\n\\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Bergen\\n\\nHieronymus Scholeus\\'s impression of Bergen. The drawing was made in about 1580 and was published in an atlas with drawings of many different cities ( Civitaes orbis terrarum ).[5]\\n\\nThe city of Bergen was traditionally thought to have been founded by king Olav Kyrre, son of Harald Hardråde in 1070 AD,[6] four years after the Viking Age in England ended with the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Modern research has, however, discovered that a trading settlement had already been established in the 1020s or 1030s.[7]\\n\\nBergen gradually assumed the function of capital of Norway in the early 13th century, as the first city where a rudimentary central administration was established. The city\\'s cathedral was the site of the first royal coronation in Norway in the 1150s, and continued to host royal coronations throughout the 13th century. Bergenhus fortress dates from the 1240s and guards the entrance to the harbour in Bergen. The functions of the capital city were lost to Oslo during the reign of King Haakon V (1299–1319).\\n\\nIn the middle of the 14th century, North German merchants, who had already been present in substantial numbers since the 13th century, founded one of the four Kontore of the Hanseatic League at Bryggen in Bergen. The principal export traded from Bergen was dried cod from the northern Norwegian coast,[8] which started around 1100. The city was granted a monopoly for trade from the north of Norway by King Håkon Håkonsson (1217–1263).[9] Stockfish was the main reason that the city became one of North Europe\\'s largest centres for trade.[9] By the late 14th century, Bergen had established itself as the centre of the trade in Norway.[10] The Hanseatic merchants lived in their own separate quarter of the town, where Middle Low German was used, enjoying exclusive rights to trade with the northern fishermen who each summer sailed to Bergen.[11] The Hansa community resented Scottish merchants who settled in Bergen, and on 9 November 1523 several Scottish households were targeted by German residents.[12] Today, Bergen\\'s old quayside, Bryggen, is on UNESCO\\'s list of World Heritage Sites.[13]\\n\\nAn historic photochrom of Bergen near the end of the 19th century. Visible are Bergen Cathedral (Domkirken) in the bottom left corner, Holy Cross Church in the middle, the bay (Vågen) with its many boats and the Bergenhus Fortress to the right of the opening of Vågen.\\n\\nIn 1349, the Black Death was brought to Norway by an English ship arriving in Bergen.[14] Later outbreaks occurred in 1618, 1629 and 1637, on each occasion taking about 3,000 lives.[15] In the 15th century, the city was attacked several times by the Victual Brothers,[16] and in 1429 they succeeded in burning the royal castle and much of the city. In 1665, the city\\'s harbour was the site of the Battle of Vågen, when an English naval flotilla attacked a Dutch merchant and treasure fleet supported by the city\\'s garrison. Accidental fires sometimes got out of control, and one in 1702 reduced most of the town to ashes.[17]\\n\\nThroughout the 15th and 16th centuries, Bergen remained one of the largest cities in Scandinavia, and it was Norway\\'s biggest city until the 1830s,[18] when the capital city of Oslo became the largest. From around 1600, the Hanseatic dominance of the city\\'s trade gradually declined in favour of Norwegian merchants (often of Hanseatic ancestry), and in the 1750s, the Kontor, or major trading post of the Hanseatic League, finally closed. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Bergen was involved in the Atlantic slave trade. Bergen-based slave trader Jørgen Thormøhlen, the largest shipowner in Norway, was the main owner of the slave ship Cornelia, which made two slave-trading voyages in 1673 and 1674 respectively; he also developed the city\\'s industrial sector, particularly in the neighbourhood of Møhlenpris, which is named after him.[19] Bergen retained its monopoly of trade with northern Norway until 1789.[20] The Bergen stock exchange, the Bergen børs, was established in 1813.\\n\\nModern history [ edit ]\\n\\nBergen was separated from Hordaland as a county of its own in 1831.[21] It was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The rural municipality of Bergen landdistrikt was merged with Bergen on 1 January 1877. The rural municipality of Årstad was merged with Bergen on 1 July 1915.[22]\\n\\nDuring World War II, Bergen was occupied on the first day of the German invasion on 9 April 1940, after a brief fight between German ships and the Norwegian coastal artillery. The Norwegian resistance movement groups in Bergen were Saborg, Milorg, \"Theta-gruppen\", Sivorg, Stein-organisasjonen and the Communist Party.[23] On 20 April 1944, during the German occupation, the Dutch cargo ship Voorbode anchored off the Bergenhus Fortress, loaded with over 120 tons of explosives, and blew up, killing at least 150 people and damaging historic buildings. The city was subject to some Allied bombing raids, aimed at German naval installations in the harbour. Some of these caused Norwegian civilian casualties numbering about 100.\\n\\nBergen is also well known in Norway for the Isdal Woman (Norwegian: Isdalskvinnen), an unidentified person who was found dead at Isdalen (\"Ice Valley\") on 29 November 1970.[24] The unsolved case encouraged international speculation over the years and it remains one of the most profound mysteries in recent Norwegian history.[25][26]\\n\\nThe rural municipalities of Arna, Fana, Laksevåg, and Åsane were merged with Bergen on 1 January 1972. The city lost its status as a separate county on the same date,[27] and Bergen is now a municipality, in the county of Vestland.\\n\\nFires [ edit ]\\n\\nThe city\\'s history is marked by numerous great fires. In 1198, the Bagler faction set fire to the city in connection with a battle against the Birkebeiner faction during the civil war. In 1248, Holmen and Sverresborg burned, and 11 churches were destroyed. In 1413 another fire struck the city, and 14 churches were destroyed. In 1428 the city was plundered by the Victual Brothers, and in 1455, Hanseatic merchants were responsible for burning down Munkeliv Abbey. In 1476, Bryggen burned down in a fire started by a drunk trader. In 1582, another fire hit the city centre and Strandsiden. In 1675, 105 buildings burned down in Øvregaten. In 1686 another great fire hit Strandsiden, destroying 231 city blocks and 218 boathouses. The greatest fire in history was in 1702, when 90% of the city was burned to ashes. In 1751, there was a great fire at Vågsbunnen. In 1756, yet another fire at Strandsiden burned down 1,500 buildings, and further great fires hit Strandsiden in 1771 and 1901. In 1916, 300 buildings burned down in the city centre including the Swan pharmacy, the oldest pharmacy in Norway, and in 1955 parts of Bryggen burned down.\\n\\nToponymy [ edit ]\\n\\nBergen is pronounced in English or and in Norwegian [ˈbæ̀rɡn̩] () (in the local dialect [ˈbæ̂ʁɡɛn]). The Old Norse forms of the name were Bergvin [ˈberɡˌwin] and Bjǫrgvin [ˈbjɔrɡˌwin] (and in Icelandic and Faroese the city is still called Björgvin). The first element is berg (n.) or bjǫrg (n.), which translates as \\'mountain(s)\\'. The last element is vin (f.), which means a new settlement where there used to be a pasture or meadow. The full meaning is then \"the meadow among the mountains\".[28] This is a suitable name: Bergen is often called \"the city among the seven mountains\". It was the playwright Ludvig Holberg who felt so inspired by the seven hills of Rome, that he decided that his home town must be blessed with a corresponding seven mountains – and locals still argue which seven they are.\\n\\nIn 1918, there was a campaign to reintroduce the Norse form Bjørgvin as the name of the city. This was turned down – but as a compromise, the name of the diocese was changed to Bjørgvin bispedømme.[29]\\n\\nGeography [ edit ]\\n\\nBergen occupies most of the peninsula of Bergenshalvøyen in the district of Midthordland in mid-western Hordaland. The municipality covers an area of 465 square kilometres (180 square miles). Most of the urban area is on or close to a fjord or bay, although the urban area has several mountains. The city centre is surrounded by the Seven Mountains, although there is disagreement as to which of the nine mountains constitute these. Ulriken, Fløyen, Løvstakken and Damsgårdsfjellet are always included as well as three of Lyderhorn, Sandviksfjellet, Blåmanen, Rundemanen and Kolbeinsvarden.[30] Gullfjellet is Bergen\\'s highest mountain, at 987 metres (3,238 ft) above mean sea level.[31] Bergen is far enough north that during clear nights at the solstice, there is borderline civil daylight in spite of the sun having set.[32]\\n\\nBergen is sheltered from the North Sea by the islands Askøy, Holsnøy (the municipality of Meland) and Sotra (the municipalities of Fjell and Sund). Bergen borders the municipalities Alver and Osterøy to the north, Vaksdal and Samnanger to the east, Os (Bjørnafjorden) and Austevoll to the south, and Øygarden and Askøy to the west.\\n\\nView of the city centre from Mt. Fløyen\\n\\nClimate [ edit ]\\n\\nBergen on a rainy day\\n\\nBergen has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), with mild summers and cool winters. Rainfall is plentiful in all seasons, along with intermittent snowfall during winter, which often melts quickly. The exceptionally plentiful precipitation that defines the city is caused by orographic lift, sometimes causing more than two months of consecutive rainy days.[33] The city is therefore considered the rainiest city in Europe, although it is not the wettest \"place\" on the continent.[34][35][36]\\n\\nBergen\\'s weather is much warmer than the city\\'s latitude (60.4° N) might suggest. Temperatures below −10 °C (14 °F) are rare. Summer temperatures sometimes reach the upper 20s, although temperatures over 30 °C were previously only seen a few days each decade. The growing season in Bergen is exceptionally long for its latitude, more than 200 days. Its mild winters and proximity to the Gulf Stream provide the city with a plant hardiness zone of 8b and 9a depending on location; this zone is much more common below 50°N even in Europe, with cities as far south as Bordeaux, Thessaloniki and Istanbul falling into this category.

In addition, 8.1% were first or second generation immigrants of Western background and 7.4% were first or second generation immigrants of non-Western background.[52] The population grew by 4,549 people in 2009, a growth rate of 1,8%. Ninety-six percent of the population lives in urban areas. As of 2002, the average gross income for men above the age of 17 is 426,000 Norwegian krone (NOK), the average gross income for women above the age of 17 is NOK 238,000, with the total average gross income being NOK 330,000.[52] In 2007, there were 104.6 men for every 100 women in the age group of 20–39.[52] 22.8% of the population were under 17 years of age, while 4.5% were 80 and above.\\n\\nThe immigrant population (those with two foreign-born parents) in Bergen, includes 42,169 individuals with backgrounds from more than 200 countries representing 15.5% of the city\\'s population (2014). Of these, 50.2% have background from Europe, 28.9% from Asia, 13.1% from Africa, 5.5% from Latin America, 1.9% from North America, and 0.4% from Oceania. The immigrant population in Bergen in the period 1993–2008 increased by 119.7%, while the ethnic Norwegian population grew by 8.1% during the same period. The national average is 138.0% and 4.2%. The immigrant population has thus accounted for 43.6% of Bergen\\'s population growth and 60.8% of Norway\\'s population growth during the period 1993–2008, compared with 84.5% in Oslo.[53]\\n\\nThe immigrant population in Bergen has changed a lot since 1970. As of 1 January 1986, there were 2,870 people with a non-Western immigrant background in Bergen. In 2006, this figure had increased to 14,630, so the non-Western immigrant population in Bergen was five times higher than in 1986. This is a slightly slower growth than the national average, which has sextupled during the same period. Also in relation to the total population in Bergen, the proportion of non-Westerns increased significantly. In 1986, the proportion of the total population in the municipality of non-Western background was 3.6%. In January 2006, people with a non-Western immigrant background accounted for 6 percent of the population in Bergen. The share of Western immigrants has remained stable at around 2% in the period. The number of Poles in Bergen rose from 697 in 2006 to 3,128 in 2010.[54]\\n\\nThe Church of Norway is the largest denomination in Bergen, with 201,006 (79.74%) registered adherents in 2012. Bergen is the seat of the Diocese of Bjørgvin with Bergen Cathedral as its centrepiece, while St John\\'s Church is the city\\'s most prominent. As of 2012, the state church is followed by 52,059 irreligious,[55] 4,947 members of various Protestant free churches, 3,873 actively registered Catholics,[56][57] 2,707 registered Muslims, 816 registered Hindus, 255 registered Russian Orthodox and 147 registered Oriental Orthodox.\\n\\nCityscape [ edit ]\\n\\nNight view of Bergen from Mount Floyen\\n\\nThe city centre of Bergen lies in the west of the municipality, facing the fjord of Byfjorden. It is among a group of mountains known as the Seven Mountains, although the number is a matter of definition. From here, the urban area of Bergen extends to the north, west and south, and to its east is a large mountain massif. Outside the city centre and the surrounding neighbourhoods (i.e. Årstad, inner Laksevåg and Sandviken), the majority of the population lives in relatively sparsely populated residential areas built after 1950. While some are dominated by apartment buildings and modern terraced houses (e.g. Fyllingsdalen), others are dominated by single-family homes.[58]\\n\\nView of the city centre with Torgallmenningen\\n\\nThe oldest part of Bergen is the area around the bay of Vågen in the city centre. Originally centred on the bay\\'s eastern side, Bergen eventually expanded west and southwards. Few buildings from the oldest period remain, the most significant being St Mary\\'s Church from the 12th century. For several hundred years, the extent of the city remained almost constant. The population was stagnant, and the city limits were narrow.[59] In 1702, seven-eighths of the city burned. Most of the old buildings of Bergen, including Bryggen (which was rebuilt in a mediaeval style), were built after the fire. The fire marked a transition from tar covered houses, as well as the remaining log houses, to painted and some brick-covered wooden buildings.[60]\\n\\nThe last half of the 19th century saw a period of rapid expansion and modernisation. The fire of 1855 west of Torgallmenningen led to the development of regularly sized city blocks in this area of the city centre. The city limits were expanded in 1876, and Nygård, Møhlenpris and Sandviken were urbanized with large-scale construction of city blocks housing both the poor and the wealthy.[61] Their architecture is influenced by a variety of styles; historicism, classicism and Art Nouveau.[62] The wealthy built villas between Møhlenpris and Nygård, and on the side of Mount Fløyen; these areas were also added to Bergen in 1876. Simultaneously, an urbanization process was taking place in Solheimsviken in Årstad, at that time outside the Bergen municipality, centred on the large industrial activity in the area.[63] The workers\\' homes in this area were poorly built, and little remains after large-scale redevelopment in the 1960s–1980s.\\n\\nSince 2000, the city of Bergen has been governed by a city government (byråd) based on the principle of\\n\\nAfter Årstad became a part of Bergen in 1916, a development plan was applied to the new area. Few city blocks akin to those in Nygård and Møhlenpris were planned. Many of the worker class built their own homes, and many small, detached apartment buildings were built. After World War II, Bergen had again run short of land to build on, and, contrary to the original plans, many large apartment buildings were built in Landås in the 1950s and 1960s. Bergen acquired Fyllingsdalen from Fana municipality in 1955. Like similar areas in Oslo (e.g. Lambertseter), Fyllingsdalen was developed into a modern suburb with large apartment buildings, mid-rises, and some single-family homes, in the 1960s and 1970s. Similar developments took place beyond Bergen\\'s city limits, for example in Loddefjord.[64]\\n\\nView from the Nordnes part of Bergen\\n\\nAt the same time as planned city expansion took place inside Bergen, its extra-municipal suburbs also grew rapidly. Wealthy citizens of Bergen had been living in Fana since the 19th century, but as the city expanded it became more convenient to settle in the municipality. Similar processes took place in Åsane and Laksevåg. Most of the homes in these areas are detached row houses,[clarification needed] single family homes or small apartment buildings.[64] After the surrounding municipalities were merged with Bergen in 1972, expansion has continued in largely the same manner, although the municipality encourages condensing near commercial centres, future Bergen Light Rail stations, and elsewhere.[65][66]\\n\\nAs part of the modernisation wave of the 1950s and 1960s, and due to damage caused by World War II, the city government ambitiously planned redevelopment of many areas in central Bergen. The plans involved demolition of several neighbourhoods of wooden houses, namely Nordnes, Marken, and Stølen. None of the plans was carried out in its original form; the Marken and Stølen redevelopment plans were discarded and that of Nordnes only carried out in the area that had been most damaged by war. The city council of Bergen had in 1964 voted to demolish the entirety of Marken, however, the decision proved to be highly controversial and the decision was reversed in 1974. Bryggen was under threat of being wholly or partly demolished after the fire of 1955, when a large number of the buildings burned to the ground. Instead of being demolished, the remaining buildings were restored and accompanied by reconstructions of some of the burned buildings.[64]\\n\\nDemolition of old buildings and occasionally whole city blocks is still taking place, the most recent major example being the 2007 razing of Jonsvollskvartalet at Nøstet.[67]\\n\\nBillboards are banned in the city.[68]\\n\\nPanorama of the reconstructed Hanseatic buildings of Bryggen , a World Heritage Site\\n\\nAdministration [ edit ]\\n\\nparliamentarism.[69] The government consists of seven government members called commissioners, and is appointed by the city council, the supreme authority of the city.\\n\\nThis is the political party breakdown of the current and historical city councils:\\n\\nBoroughs [ edit ]\\n\\nBoroughs of Bergen\\n\\nBergen is divided into eight boroughs,[94] as seen on the map to the right. Clockwise, starting with the northernmost, the boroughs are Åsane, Arna, Fana, Ytrebygda, Fyllingsdalen, Laksevåg, Årstad and Bergenhus. The city centre is located in Bergenhus. Parts of Fana, Ytrebygda, Åsane and Arna are not part of the Bergen urban area, explaining why the municipality has approximately 20,000 more inhabitants than the urban area.[95]\\n\\nLocal borough administrations have varied since Bergen\\'s expansion in 1972. From 1974, each borough had a politically chosen administration. From 1989, Bergen was divided into 12 health and social districts, each locally administered. From 2000 to 2004, the former organizational form with eight politically chosen local administrations was again in use and from 2008 through to 2010, a similar form existed where the local administrations had less power than previously.[96]\\n\\nApartment buildings in Fyllingsdalen in 2008\\n\\nBorough Population[97] % Area (km2) % Density\\n\\n(/km2) Arna 12,680 4.9 102.44 22.0 123 Bergenhus1 38,544 14.8 26.58 5.7 4.415 Fana 38,317 14.8 159.70 34.3 239 Fyllingsdalen 28,844 11.1 18.84 4.0 1.530 Laksevåg 38,391 14.8 32.72 7.0 1.173 Ytrebygda 25,710 9.9 39.61 8.5 649 Årstad2 37,614 14.5 14.78 3.2 4.440 Åsane 39,534 15.2 71.01 15.2 556 Not stated 758 Total 260,392 100 465.68 100 559\\n\\n(Pertaining to the table above: The acreage figures include fresh water and uninhabited mountain areas, except:\\n\\n1 1 The borough Bergenhus is 8.73 km2 (3.37 sq mi), the rest is water and uninhabited mountain areas.\\n\\n2 2 The borough Årstad is 8.47 km2 (3.27 sq mi), the rest is water and uninhabited mountain areas.)\\n\\nFormer borough: Sentrum\\n\\nSentrum (literally, \"Centre\") was a borough (with the same name as a present-day neighbourhood).

The university has a broad range of courses and research in academic fields and three national centres of excellence, in climate research, petroleum research and medieval studies.[107] The main campus is located in the city centre. The university co-operates with Haukeland University Hospital within medical research. The Chr.

The college was created through amalgamation in 1994; campuses are spread around town but will be co-located at Kronstad. The Norwegian School of Economics is located in outer Sandviken and is the leading business school in Norway,[110] having produced three Economy Nobel Prize laureates.[111] The school has more than 3,000 students and approximately 400 staff.[112] Other tertiary education institutions include the Bergen School of Architecture, the Bergen National Academy of the Arts, located in the city centre with 300 students,[113] and the Norwegian Naval Academy located in Laksevåg. The Norwegian Institute of Marine Research has been located in Bergen since 1900. It provides research and advice relating to ecosystems and aquaculture.

The Bergen Storm are an American football team that plays matches at Varden Kunstgress and plays in the second division of the Norwegian league.\\n\\nBergensk is the native dialect of Bergen. It was strongly influenced by Low German-speaking merchants from the mid-14th to mid-18th centuries. During the Dano-Norwegian period from 1536 to 1814, Bergen was more influenced by Danish than other areas of Norway. The Danish influence removed the female grammatical gender in the 16th century, making Bergensk one of very few Norwegian dialects with only two instead of three grammatical genders. The Rs are uvular trills, as in French, which probably spread to Bergen some time in the 18th century, overtaking the alveolar trill in the time span of two to three generations. Owing to an improved literacy rate, Bergensk was influenced by riksmål and bokmål in the 19th and 20th centuries. This led to large parts of the German-inspired vocabulary disappearing and pronunciations shifting slightly towards East Norwegian.[151]\\n\\nThe 1986 edition of the Eurovision Song Contest took place in Bergen. Bergen was the host city for the 2017 UCI Road World Championships. The city is also a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the category of gastronomy since 2015.[152]\\n\\nPicture of Bryggen from the opposite pier during night time.

Other internationally well-received artists also originating from Bergen include Aurora, Sondre Lerche, Kygo, Boy Pablo and Alan Walker. Bergen is also known as the \"black metal capital of Norway\", due to its role in the early Norwegian black metal scene and the amount of acts to come from the city in the early 1990s. Also the singer Einar Selvik of the band Wardruna was born in Bergen and became famous thanks to the TV series Vikings.[153]\\n\\nBergen is also the birthplace of composer Edvard Grieg.\\n\\nStreet art [ edit ]\\n\\nBergen is considered to be the street art capital of Norway.[154] Famed artist Banksy visited the city in 2000[155] and inspired many to start creating street art. Soon after, the city brought up the most famous street artist in Norway: Dolk.[156][157] His art can still be seen in several places in the city, and in 2009 the city council choose to preserve Dolk\\'s work \"Spray\" with protective glass.[158] In 2011, Bergen council launched a plan of action for street art in Bergen from 2011 to 2015 to ensure that \"Bergen will lead the fashion for street art as an expression both in Norway and Scandinavia\".[159]\\n\\nThe Madam Felle (1831–1908) monument in Sandviken, is in honour of a Norwegian woman of German origin, who in the mid-19th century managed, against the will of the council, to maintain a counter of beer. A well-known restaurant of the same name is now situated at another location in Bergen. The monument was erected in 1990 by sculptor Kari Rolfsen, supported by an anonymous donor. Madam Felle, civil name Oline Fell, was remembered after her death in a popular song, possibly originally a folksong,[160] \"Kjenner Dokker Madam Felle?\" by Lothar Lindtner and Rolf Berntzen on an album in 1977.\\n\\nMedia [ edit ]\\n\\nNewspapers [ edit ]\\n\\nNeighbourhoods [ edit ]\\n\\nThe traditional neighbourhoods of Bergen include Bryggen, Eidemarken, Engen, Fjellet,\\n\\nKalfaret, Ladegården, Løvstakksiden,[161] Marken, Minde,\\n\\nMøhlenpris, Nordnes, Nygård, Nøstet, Sandviken,\\n\\nSentrum, Skansen, Skuteviken, Strandsiden, Stølen, Sydnes,\\n\\nVerftet, Vågsbunnen, Wergeland,[162] and Ytre Sandviken.\\n\\nGrunnkretser [ edit ]\\n\\nThe various addresses in Bergen, each belong to one of the various grunnkrets.\\n\\nInternational business [ edit ]\\n\\nEach year Bergen sells the Christmas Tree seen in Newcastle\\'s Haymarket as a sign of the ongoing friendship between the sister cities.[163] The Nordic friendship cities of Bergen, Gothenburg, Turku and Aarhus arrange inter-Nordic camps each year by registering tenth grade school classes from each of the other cities to school camps, for a profit.

       "'Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a \"batteries included\" language due to its comprehensive standard library.Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.'"
