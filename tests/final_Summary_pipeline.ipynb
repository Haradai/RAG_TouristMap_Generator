This is where King Olaf III founded Bergen in 1070 CE, and where merchants from the Hanseatic League grew rich off North Sea trade. The excellent Bryggens Museum has much more on this fascinating history.\n",

Local chefs have revived traditional dishes like persetorsk (a type of “pressed cod” cured in salt and sugar). Divers harvest fresh oysters in the fjords. And the old Fish Market has been repurposed into an upscale dining hall where seafood restaurants serve the best local catch.  Week 29: Outdoor games from times past.

A lovely area is Indre Sandviken, with charming alleys, street art, and old houses. Try a waffle with Norwegian brown cheese at the kitsch but homely Bar Barista in Øvregaten, which is full of interesting old trinkets. In the evenings, the owner often plays music from his extensive vinyl collection. Stop at Bod 24, located in an old storage room in Sandviken, for a tasty lunch – especially recommended when you can sit outdoors on the pier. Close by you’ll find the friendly and down-to-earth water hole Dr. Wiesener. They are also well-known for their “raspeballer”, traditional Norwegian potato dumplings.\n",
